time complexity measure:
1. Experimentel method
2. Analytical method

Experimental method:

-implement the algorithm into the code and execute it
-hardware and software
-cannot consider all inputs
-cannot measure exact running time

Analytical method:
-measure running time based on input size . not necessar
y to run the program


conider reules
1. if you have assignment,arithmetic,relational,logical operator, it will take 1 unit of time
2. if you have a return statement, it will take 1 unit of time
3. avoid the constant term
4. avoid the coeffiecient

bestv  case average case and worst case

analytical method measure the rate of growth of time taken by an algorithm depending on input size

--Asympototic notation:

1. omega notation: best case
2. Thets notation :avarage case: Tight  bound
3. Big-O notation :worst case: upperbound



Big -O notation : mathematical representation or mathematical notation that describes the limiting of an 
algorithnm when the input tends towards a particular value of infinity.


predefined notation :order

--------
-O(1)--constant term
-O(logn)--logarithm time complexicity
-O(n)--linear time complexicity
-O(nlogn)-linear logarithm time complexity
-O(n^2) ,O(n^3)--quadratica time complexicity
O(2^n),)(3^n)-exponential


what is an algorithm ?

why to write algorithm before wrieting a code?

Time complexicity measure method:

experimental method
analytical ,ethod

Big-O notation


search algorithm
linear,binary
sorting algo:
Bubble sort,merge,quick sort
