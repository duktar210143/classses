types of graph 
1. NUll graph:

a null garph is defines as null graph which cinsist og no 
conected graph

2. directed and undirected graph:
edge oriented directed not oiented undirected

3. connected and disconnected graph
connected by a path and any vertex can reach another graph it is connected and vice versa is unconnected


4. simple graph 
with no loops and multiple loops undireacted

5. Multi graph
with loops and multiple graph

6. complete graph (kn)
every vertex is connected to each other

7. Regular graph
A graph is called to be a regualr if all the vertices of the garph have the same degree
all regular graph arent complete garph but all complete grapg are regualr graph


8. cycle grapg(cn)

consisting of a single cycle .it is called a cycle garph 
cycle it needs three vertex with minimum one cycle 
initial vertex sjhould meet the end vertex


9.wheels graph
    a eheel graph is just like a cycle . with one additional vertes which is 
    connected to evevry other vertex
wheels of n vertices are  donoted br Wn

10 bipartitite graph

the vertices are divided into two differernt parts


11 complete bipartite graph
if the vertices are divided into two different parts such that all the vertices of the first part
are connected to teh vertices of  a second vertex


12. weighted graph
each branch or edge is given a numerical weight .
