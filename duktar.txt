Algorithm:
-------
-the process or set of rules which is written in a native language in order to perform 
a specific task or computation.
-like reciepe


problem: add two numbers:


Algorithm:
=========
algorithm:
-----
step 1= first take a first value
step 2= take a second value
step 3= add the first value and second value of step 1 and step 2 respectively
step 4= put the output of step 3 in a variabe c
step 5: display the value of c.


Why should we write an algorithm before writing code
----> If we write an algorithm it is not necessary to know the particular language syntax.
----> we  can only focus on logic

code:
programming rules
Logic


write an algorithm to find a factirial num?

now that it 











step 1---> fist take a value as input from user
step 2----> provide a variable with value 1
step 3---> use for loop 
step 4---> in step 3 provide a range which ranges from 2 to number 1 less then the input number
step 5---> inside the block use i+=1
step 6---> use mul=mul*i
step 7----> print or display step 6

which algorithm is better?

-We have to analyse all the algorithm

analysis algorithm: time complexity, space complexitit

Time complexity- time taken by an algorithm to perform a pariticular task
space complexiti- space taken by an algoritm to perform a particualar time



how to find the time complexity ??


why is algorithm written before writing the code?

->to focus on logic
->not necessary of any particular programming language
->we cam implement in any programmming language


algorithm process:

conditional statement
Loop 
Function


example

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

num=
if num is divisible by 3, print Fizz
if num  is div by 5, print Buzz
if num is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz

--right way
1. Take a value in num
2.IF num is exactly divisible by three


-Common rules:

- all the key words should be capitalized



==Algorithm
1. Flowchart
2. pseudocode
3. Code

==Flowchart:
-----
- it's pictorial representation or diagrammatical representation of an algorithm.
Symbols:

oval-->start/end
rectangle->process
parallelogram-->input/output
Diamond-->condition/decision
line with arrow head -->flow
round small circle-->connector


==Pseudocode
-similar to the code.
-There is no rules for writing pseuducode
-symbols and operator can be use->


1. a:=12
2. b:=15
3. c=a+b
4 print the value of c


focus on this three things while writing pseudo code


num=int(input("enter a number"))
if num%3 and num%5:
    print("fizz buzz")
elif num%3:
    print("fizz")
elif num%5:
    print('BUZZ')


pseudo code of above:

num=15
IF num%3==0 and num%5==0 THEN
    print("fiz buzz")

ELIF num%3==0 THEN 
    print("fizz")
ELSE 
    print("num")

==Loop:
FOR, WHILE,DO WHILE(:)=DO
for i in range(10):
    print(i)


Pseudocode:
-----
FOR I from 0 to 9 DO
    print(i)



i=0
while i<5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

I=0
WHILE I<5 DO
    PRINT(i)
