--hello everyone
 my name is duktar tamang
I am a student at softwarica collage batch 30 
sec A my student ID is 210143

--I made a simple calculator using pycharm
the code is presented here on the screen

firstly the basics
what we did here is in line no 1
 importing evrything from tkinter python library
then creating a loop  that loops the window until the user exits it using Tk()
and window.mainloop()

in line no 7 we create a entry system and expand the width
using grid we shove the  widget 
column span is used to fill in the three columns that we will built further in the code


we will get to everything inside the fuction later

we create 9 button's with different paddings and using grid 
method to place the buttons into Rows and columns making it as
similar to real calculator

we also create buttons for arithmetic calculation like add,subtract,multiply,division and eqaual
we use  lambda to pass parameters in  buttons 

 now on to the functions on def click()
- we want a number the one which the user clicks save the state
  and also be able to insert another number.
- So we store the first value in a variable
-the concatinating the numbers present in the  screen widget and the new numbers

going onto clear button:
we just use a function e.delete(0,END) to clear evrything inside the entry widget.

now onto the arithematic functions

we want to click buttons and get different out put based on 
which operator buttons the user clicks on

for that we first create buttons and use differnt paddings and 
place it using grid into different 

well here on the def button_add:
    we first call the first number on the entry widget
    then we create a global variable 
    assighning the global number an intiger value which is a global and can be used outside the functuion
    
Then basically using another global variable math 
    we check the  should be provided as output  when clicking on which button by 
    using a simple if else statement and providing the necessary codes
   for add sub mul and division
